# Etherium-mining-Cpu-2022
lets try one more time to mine Etherium noe on PC with cpu gpu power


my previous github : https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

little tutorial --- i have upgraded my previous script and algorithm. 
but still the math are same but according to the modern 10GEN tech CPU GPU and logic board i made some changes. 
Once again it is still possible to mininh Etherium. 
lets try

 ********* MUST  READ  BEFORE  USE ********


#1 extract the zip folder on  desktop  
ethminer-0.19.0-alpha.0-cuda10.0-windows-amd64.zip

#2 there  will be  a folder called bin 
open the 'bin' folder open it

3# you will find  " kernels "   folder   "ethminer.exe"    " cpu gpu synchronizer.cmd "  and   "cpu gpu boost.exe"

4# First run the ethminer.exe "run as administrator'

5# Second run the "cpu gpu synchronizer.cmd " by  "run as administrator"  or u can double click on it.  [ it is for make your cpu and gpu cool from over heating.  and use less electricity as  possible]

6# Third, now last step is double click on  "cpu gpu boost.exe"  run the booster.  [ it will boost your cpu and gpu and keep ballance on boost time to time. ]

1#----Run ethminer.exe
2#--- Run  cpu gpu synchronizer.cmd
3#--- Run cpu gpu boos.exe
4#--- follow my github how to put your own Ethereum address for mining
